# IPL Score Prediction using Ensemble Modeling and AutoML

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match scores using ensemble modeling techniques and AutoML (Automated Machine Learning). The notebook contains the implementation of various machine learning models combined with AutoML approaches to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Features

- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combines multiple machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **AutoML Integration**: Utilizes automated machine learning techniques to streamline model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- **IPL Data Analysis**: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization specific to IPL match data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compares different models and ensemble techniques to identify the best-performing approach.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - AutoML library (e.g., TPOT, Auto-sklearn, H2O)
  - matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ipl-score-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ipl_score_prediction_copy2.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the IPL dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Train and evaluate individual models.
   - Implement ensemble techniques.
   - Apply AutoML for automated model selection and tuning.
   - Compare model performance and visualize results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical IPL match data, including:
- Team statistics
- Player performances
- Match conditions (venue, toss, etc.)
- Historical scores

Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed insights into:
- Model accuracy and performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).
- Feature importance analysis.
- Comparison between individual models and ensemble approaches.
- Visualizations of predictions vs. actual scores.
